# Personal Portfolio
This is a portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and experiences. The website is built using React, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Tech Stack
- React
- CSS (including custom fonts from Google Fonts)
- JavaScript

### React ⚛️
It's my first time introducing React.js on a project, and these are my reasons to start introducing it:
- Reusable Components: React allows for building reusable UI components that can be used throughout the application.
- Virtual DOM: React's virtual DOM improves performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the browser's DOM.
- Unidirectional Data Flow: React's unidirectional data flow makes it easier to reason about the application's state and how it changes over time.
- Strong Community and Ecosystem: React has a large and active community, with plenty of resources and libraries available.
- Flexibility: React is a library, not a framework, giving developers flexibility to choose the best tools for their specific project needs.

## Features
- Responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes
- Custom animations for a visually appealing user experience
- Projects section with images, descriptions, and links to live demos
- Skills section highlighting my proficiency in various technologies
- Contact section with a contact form and links to my social media profiles

## Process
This project was a great opportunity for me to practice my front-end development skills, particularly in animations. I struggled a lot with getting the animations to work exactly as I wanted, but I learned a lot about CSS animations and transitions in the process. I also experimented with different design elements, such as custom fonts and colors, to create a visually appealing website.

## Conclusions and Learnings
Throughout the process of building this portfolio, I learned the importance of planning and organizing my code before diving into development. I also learned how to effectively use CSS animations and transitions to create a dynamic user experience. Additionally, I gained experience working with custom fonts and colors to create a unique and visually appealing design.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience and a great opportunity to showcase my skills and experiences as a front-end developer.
